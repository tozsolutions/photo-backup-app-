## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set production environment variables
cp .env.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with production values
```

### 2. Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# Test the built application
```

### 3. Docker Deployment
```bash
docker build -t photo-backup-app .
docker run -p 80:80 photo-backup-app
# Test Docker container
```

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- Verify all GitHub Actions are passing
- Check deployment status
- Monitor application logs

### 5. Post-deployment

- [ ] Error monitoring active

## Rollback Plan

1. Keep previous Docker image tagged
2. Maintain database backups if applicable
3. Have rollback scripts ready
4. Monitor error rates after deployment

## Monitoring

- Application performance metrics
- Error rates and logging
- User experience metrics
- Network performance
- PWA installation rates
